### 🔄 **Smart Variable System**

Use dynamic variables like `{site_name}`, `{site_url}`, and `{option:admin_email}` in any field. Update your information in one place, and it updates everywhere automatically.

### ✅ **Google-Validated Output**

Every schema output is structured to pass Google's Rich Results Test and Schema.org validation. We follow Google's guidelines precisely so you can trust your markup is correct.
