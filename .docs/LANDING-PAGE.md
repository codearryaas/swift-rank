## ❓ FAQ Section

### Headline
**Common Questions Answered**

### Subtitle
Get quick answers to frequently asked questions about Swift Rank

### FAQ Accordion

#### What is schema markup and why do I need it?
Schema markup is structured data that helps search engines understand your content better. It can result in rich snippets (star ratings, images, prices) in search results, leading to higher click-through rates and better SEO performance.

#### Do I need coding skills to use Swift Rank?
Absolutely not! Swift Rank is designed for non-technical users. The visual interface and setup wizard make it easy for anyone to add schema markup. If you can use WordPress, you can use Swift Rank.

#### What schema types does Swift Rank support?
**Free version:** Article, Product, Organization, Person, LocalBusiness, Review, VideoObject, FAQ, Breadcrumb, Job Posting, WebPage, Website, ImageObject

**Pro version:** All free types plus Recipe, Event, HowTo, Podcast Episode, and Custom Schema Builder

#### How is Swift Rank different from other schema plugins?
Swift Rank offers unique features like Auto Schema (automatic schema generation), template-based automation, import/export functionality, and a setup wizard. It's designed to be both powerful for developers and easy for beginners.

#### Will Swift Rank work with my theme and plugins?
Yes! Swift Rank is compatible with all WordPress themes and works seamlessly with popular plugins like Yoast SEO, WooCommerce, and page builders.

#### How soon will I see rich snippets in search results?
After implementing schema markup, Google needs to recrawl your pages. This can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. Swift Rank ensures your markup is correct, but Google decides when and if to show rich snippets.

#### Can I use Swift Rank with Yoast SEO or Rank Math?
Yes! Swift Rank works alongside other SEO plugins. You can choose which plugin handles which schema types using our settings.

#### What's the difference between Auto Schema and Templates?
**Auto Schema** automatically generates basic schema for all posts/pages without any setup. **Templates** give you full control over schema fields and display conditions. You can use both together for maximum coverage.

#### Can I export my schema templates?
Yes! The import/export feature lets you backup templates, migrate between sites, or share configurations with team members.

#### [Icon: HelpCircle] Is there a money-back guarantee?
Yes! Swift Rank Pro comes with a 14-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied, we'll refund your purchase, no questions asked.
