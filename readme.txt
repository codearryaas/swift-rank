== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need coding skills to use Swift Rank? =

Absolutely not! Swift Rank is designed for non-technical users. The visual interface and setup wizard make it easy for anyone to add schema markup. If you can use WordPress, you can use Swift Rank.

= How is Swift Rank different from other schema plugins? =

Swift Rank offers unique features like Auto Schema (automatic schema generation), template-based automation, import/export functionality, and a setup wizard. It’s designed to be both powerful for developers and easy for beginners.

= Will Swift Rank work with my theme and plugins? =

Yes! Swift Rank is compatible with all WordPress themes and works seamlessly with popular plugins like Yoast SEO, WooCommerce, and page builders.

= How soon will I see rich snippets in search results? =

After implementing schema markup, Google needs to recrawl your pages. This can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. Swift Rank ensures your markup is correct, but Google decides when and if to show rich snippets.

= What’s the difference between Auto Schema and Templates? =

Auto Schema automatically generates basic schema for all posts/pages without any setup. Templates give you full control over schema fields and display conditions. You can use both together for maximum coverage.

Yes! The import/export feature lets you backup templates, migrate between sites, or share configurations with team members.
