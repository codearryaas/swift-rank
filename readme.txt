Simple, Powerful Schema Markup for WordPress. Boost your SEO, get rich results, and increase CTR, without coding.

== Description ==

Swift Rank makes it incredibly easy to add Schema.org structured data to your WordPress website. Boost your SEO visibility and stand out in Google search results with eye-catching rich snippets, all without writing a single line of code.

**Why Schema Markup Matters for Your WordPress Site**

Schema markup helps search engines understand your content better, leading to:

*   **Dominate Search Results**: Stand out from competitors with eye-catching rich snippets—star ratings, images, FAQs, and pricing that demand attention.
*   **Skyrocket Click-Through Rates**: Studies show rich results can increase CTR by up to 30%, driving more qualified traffic to your site for free.
*   **Help Google Understand Your Content**: Give search engines explicit clues about what your page means, not just what it says, for more accurate indexing.
*   **Establish Brand Authority**: control how your brand appears in the Knowledge Graph with correct logos, social profiles, and contact details.
*   **Future-Proof Your SEO**: Structured data is the language of AI search and voice assistants. Get your site ready for the next generation of search.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need coding skills to use Swift Rank? =

Absolutely not! Swift Rank is designed for non-technical users. The visual interface and setup wizard make it easy for anyone to add schema markup. If you can use WordPress, you can use Swift Rank.

= How is Swift Rank different from other schema plugins? =

Swift Rank offers unique features like Auto Schema (automatic schema generation), template-based automation, import/export functionality, and a setup wizard. It’s designed to be both powerful for developers and easy for beginners.

= Will Swift Rank work with my theme and plugins? =

Yes! Swift Rank is compatible with all WordPress themes and works seamlessly with popular plugins like Yoast SEO, WooCommerce, and page builders.

= How soon will I see rich snippets in search results? =

After implementing schema markup, Google needs to recrawl your pages. This can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. Swift Rank ensures your markup is correct, but Google decides when and if to show rich snippets.

Auto Schema automatically generates basic schema for all posts/pages without any setup. Templates give you full control over schema fields and display conditions. You can use both together for maximum coverage.
